# Textured

This package assists in the structuring of semi-structured data in text format (where data is arranged in a "subject:data" format) into an XML document, where data exploration and extraction is much easier and standarised (see `XML` and `xml2`).

## Installation

While it is planned to be put onto CRAN, you can currently install the development version here:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("michaelccccc/textured")
```
